Tabletop Manoa is a web application that was created for our final ICS 314 group project.  The application requires users to log in with their active University of Hawaii account.  Tabletop Manoa allowed users to browse and join the various available games and also create their own game group.  There is also a Calendar function which allows users to view what games are running on particular days.  The application utilized HTML, Javascript, Semantic UI, Meteor, and MongoDB.

I designed the 'Create Your Own Game Group' page, and I also linked it to a MongoDB collection.  One of my biggest challenges was implementing different dropdowns depending on what game category the user selected.  Since we decided the majority of the input page would be dropdowns, I did not want one humongous dropdown for the selection of the game title.  I learned quite a bit of HTML, Javascript, and Semantic UI from just this project alone.  I also became comfortable using GitHub.  I now have a better understanding about Web Development.  One of the biggest things I learned from this project was about myself.  I learned that I am passionate about coding.
