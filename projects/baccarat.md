summary: A baccarat game I developed for my ICS 321 Database class.
---

Baccarat is a game that I developed as my Spring 2015 ICS 321 final project using Java that implemented a SQL database to record the outcome of every play.

SQL database was used to record the user's name, timestamp, player's hand, banker's hand, user's pick, the outcome, and the result.
This also allowed the game to display stats like the total number of hands.  It was also used to display the number of times the outcome was Player, Banker, or a Tie.

First, you would enter your name.

<hr>
Second, you would click either Player or Banker.
<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/bac3a.png">
<hr>
Then it would display the results.

Lastly, it would display stats from the database.

This final project allowed me to learn more about SQL and about how databases work in general.  This also taught me the importance of Database Design.
