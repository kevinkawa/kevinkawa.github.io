## Meteor Gotchas

Meteor is a Web application framework that is completely new to me.  Using Meteor this week was quite an enormous challenge.  I ran into many different issues using Meteor so far.

Some of the challenges were dealing with the concepts of Client and Server files and when to put certain code into the different files.  I also had the problems with where to import the Javascript files.  The screencasts provided by Professor Johnson helped.  While doing the WODs on my own, I am still having difficulty reaching times that will not DNF.  Repetition and perseverance seems to the key.

One concept I still need help with is the router concept and the use of FlowRouter.  I have completed only upto Digits WOD part 4 so far, and I find myself having to keep repeating the previous ones to get the concepts down.  I am hoping after this weekend and many more WOD attempts I will start to grasp these concepts.  This week has been challenge, and I am extremely grateful that we were given an additional week to grasp Meteor.
