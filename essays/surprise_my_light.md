## My Experience

<p>I was pretty discouraged about this class going into the UI Design (Basics) module.  I haven't finished a in-class WOD up to this point.   I was even comtemplating about dropping the class.  I also never developed a web page before in my life.  Going through practice WODs BrowserHistory1, BrowserHistory2 and BrowserHistory3 was a very good introduction to basic web page design with HTML and CSS, but the web pages that I created weren't really eye candy.</p>

<p>Then, the Semantic UI module came along.  At first going through the three hour Semantic UI PluralSight online tutorial, the material was quite mundane and a little difficult to get through.  I kept thinking to myself, "OK, Semantic UI will just make a web page look a little bit more eye appealing".  But, after the Island Snow with Semantic UI and Your Choice with Semantic UI WODs, Semantic UI blew my mind and really sparked my interest.  I never would have thought I could decently replicate a professionally made web page so quickly.  I always assumed very expensive software and many dedicated weeks were needed to develop a web page.  Boy was I wrong.  All of the web pages I created in our WODs looked professionally made.  After the Island Snow WOD, I even went back to watch parts of the PluralSight tutorial again.  Simple things such as putting in a div class UI container makes such a huge difference in appearance.  I even catch myself hitting F12 now while browsing the web taking a few minutes to inspect the code.  I am also planning to look into other HTML Frameworks and try to experience them.  I put in a lot of time and energy in these modules, and it was definitely worth it.  I know it is late, but I believe my light bulb is starting to go on.  I even finished my WODs with AV times.  Attending the AmyWODs also definitely helped a lot.</p>

<p>I am definitely looking forward to more experience with Semantic UI and learning to create a web application.</p>
