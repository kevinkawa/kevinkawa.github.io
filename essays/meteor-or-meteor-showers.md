## Meteor or Meteor Showers

For the past couple of weeks, learning Meteor has been a quite challenge.  Going through the meteor-application-template, meteor-example-form, and the Digits modules was pretty rough and frustrating.  Unfortunately, I still do NOT have a complete understanding of all of the Meteor concepts especially the use of the Mongo Mini database and publications.  

Creating the final project mockup was the biggest help for me to understand some of the Meteor concepts.  I was pretty frustrated at first when I started to work on my mockup.  My app would often crash when I modified code from the templates.  I am very thankful for Github and the ability to commit to master every so often to save my progress.  There were many times where I had to go back to my last successful commit to master because my app would crash.  And, boy did my mockup crash often.  Many times I didn't even understand why it crashed.  I had meteor-application-template, meteor-example-form, and Digits all open and ready to reference while doing my mockup.  Thank goodness for my 4 monitor setup on my home PC.  I ended up pressing F5 everytime I modified a couple of lines of code.  It got so bad where I started praying to computer gods everytime I refreshed my localhost:3000.  Unfortunately, I wasn't committing a lot when I first started my mockup, and I ended up having to backtrack a lot to get my app working again.  I feel like I wasted a lot of time in the beginning.

I am also thankful for ESLint.  ESLint was also a tremendous help when debugging my code.  I would have probably gave up if it was not for ESLint's detection of errors.  I became extremely purplexed when my mockup would crash, and ESLint did not find any errors.  But, I guess it could have been a lot worst.  I finally got most of the stuff to work in my mockup.  I just wish I had more time before I submitted to Laulima.

I am really excited and looking forward working with Jory and Virginia on the final project.  We are creating an app for users who play table top games.  The app will help players organize get togethers.  I get to learn about table tops games which I have never played in my life.  I just consider it a generation gap thing.  I also get to learn more about Meteor, and I have the opportunity to work as a team to build an app.  Hopefully, my lack of knowledge about table top games will provide some insight to make the app appealing to people like me.
