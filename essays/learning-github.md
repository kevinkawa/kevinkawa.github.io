## My Experience

Configuration management is essential for software developers who work together to build and maintain complex and large software systems.  Learning about the three classic Configuration Management problems in this module and how RCS first resolved these problems was very interesting.  At my job, FedEx just started implementing a cloud-based system.  Previously, data was stored in spreadsheets on public hard drives.  With the public hard drives format, I also encountered some of the classic Configuration Management problems where only one user could access the file at a time (the Shared Data Problem).  There would be often be locks on the files by users where no edits could be made.  Because of our slow intranet, we would often also store local copies of the files on our PCs and upload them to the public hard drives, but this created the Double Maintenance Problem where if someone made changes to files after we downloaded a copy, we would overwrite their changes when we uploaded our copy to the public hard drive.  This new process of Push/Pull repos in Git is a completely foreign concept to me.  I look forward to learning more about the Git model (distributed CM) and working with it.
