## Future Goals

As I become closer and closer to obtaining my ICS BA degree from University at Manoa, I am slowly learning I need to gain way more experience programming to land a job.  I currently have a full-time job as a Operations Manager at FedEx Ground (not in the computer field), and I have a family to support.  I am also still undecided on what I plan to do with my degree.  I am an older student, and my main reason for returning to school was to one day have a career change.  I believe everyone should have a job that they truly love.  I really want to be able to say that one day.  I've been pretty comfortable working at FedEx Ground for over 10 years, but I am not truly happy.  I believe becoming a professional programmer would actually make me happy.  Unfortunately, I don't have the luxury of completely devoting my life to programming right now.  My goal is to hopefully save a bit money so when after I graduate I could step down to a part-time position and start my programming career.  

I returned to school back in 2011 mainly to get my first Bachelor's degree.  Since 2011, I have always been going to school part-time and working full-time.  I honestly believe all of my hard work and sacrifice is going to pay off in the end.  At least, I will have options and no regrets.
