## Javascript

As I have recently switched my major to the ICS program at UH Manoa, I've had limited exposure to different computer programming languages in my quest for a BA degree in ICS.  I am definitely not a computer programming expert yet.  Yeah, I've had a semester with Python, a year with Java, a semester in C++, and a couple of assignments with Lisp and Prolog.  But, one thing I've learned is these programming languages were were pretty similar to one another.  That is what I found fascinating about computer programming, and one of the reasons I chose ICS as my new major.  Computer programs can also do so many things.  These programming languages were similar because they consisted of data types, control constructs, and functions.  The different syntax was what I find to be the most challenging.  I also have yet to learn what makes one programming language "better" than another.

I am really looking forward to learning more about Javascript as well as other programming languages.  One interesting thing with Javascript I just learned is the type of variable is determined during runtime.  This probably has to do with the compiler design.  Hopefully, I will continue to find many more new interesting things with Javascript.  

## Athletic Software Engineering

This is also my first exposure to athletic software engineering.  When I sit in front of a computer, I take my time.  I would spend hours writing code.  I actually enjoy being in front a computer and the solitary of it.  I also enjoy playing with puzzles like the Rubik's cube.  WODs are similar to me learning to speedsolve a Rubik's cube (something I am not good at yet).  My first practice WOD was very scary, since I usually do not like to time myself doing things.  The presence of the timer is what scared me the most.  I had a total of three attempts.  Although the practice WOD was fairly easy, my first attempt was over 6 minutes (6:13 to be exact).  The second one took me 5 minutes and 20 seconds.  My last attempt was my best time at around 3 minutes and 37 seconds.  Each attempt was better than the previous mainly because I already knew how to construct the program.  I think this type of learning is good, but I need to be sure to be completely able to walk first before I try to run.
